# Unhandled Asynchronous Exceptions in Dart Completer

This example demonstrates a subtle error that can occur when working with asynchronous operations and Completers in Dart.  The code simulates an asynchronous operation that may fail.  The `try-catch` block effectively handles any `Exception` thrown by the asynchronous operation, preventing the application from crashing.

## How to reproduce

1. Save the code in `bug.dart` and `bugSolution.dart`.
2. Run it using the Dart command line: `dart bug.dart`
3. Observe the output. Modify the condition in `bug.dart` to trigger the exception.
4. Run the fixed version in `bugSolution.dart` to see the exception handled gracefully.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure proper error handling with a `try-catch` block when awaiting the `Completer.future`.  This allows for gracefully handling potential exceptions during the asynchronous operation without causing the application to crash.
